# File Name: `ShowPayrollReport.java`

## Overview
The `ShowPayrollReport.java` file is a Java class that implements the `IView` interface. It is responsible for displaying a payroll report for a specific user using the Lanterna GUI library. The class retrieves the user's payroll data from the provided repositories and displays it in a window with options to view detailed information for each payroll entry.

## Usage
The `ShowPayrollReport` class can be used in a Java application to show payroll reports to users. Below is an example of how to create an instance of `ShowPayrollReport` and display the payroll report window:

```java
// Create a MultiWindowTextGUI instance
MultiWindowTextGUI gui = new MultiWindowTextGUI();

// Create an instance of RepositoriesDto and provide necessary data
RepositoriesDto repositoriesDto = new RepositoriesDto();

// Provide the user ID for which the payroll report needs to be displayed
int userId = 123;

// Create an instance of ShowPayrollReport
ShowPayrollReport payrollReport = new ShowPayrollReport(gui, userId, repositoriesDto);

// Get the window and display it
gui.addWindowAndWait(payrollReport.getWindow());
```

### Notes

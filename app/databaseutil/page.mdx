# File Name: `DatabaseUtil.java`

## Overview:
The `DatabaseUtil.java` file contains a utility class `DatabaseUtil` that provides methods for copying a database file from resources to a temporary location and connecting to that database using JDBC SQLite.

The `copyDatabaseToTemp` method copies a database file named `myapp.db` from the resources to a temporary location. If the database file is not found in the resources, it throws a `RuntimeException`. The copied file is returned as a `File` object.

The `connectToDatabase` method utilizes the `copyDatabaseToTemp` method to copy the database file to a temporary location and then constructs a JDBC SQLite URL based on the absolute path of the copied file. It returns the constructed URL as a `String`.

## Usage:
To use the `DatabaseUtil` class to copy a database file and connect to the database, follow the example below:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Copy the database file to a temporary location
        File tempDbFile = DatabaseUtil.copyDatabaseToTemp();
        System.out.println("Database copied to: " + tempDbFile.getAbsolutePath());

        // Connect to the database
        String dbUrl = DatabaseUtil.connectToDatabase();
        System.out.println("Connected to database using URL: " + dbUrl);
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the database file `myapp.db` exists in the resources directory.
- The utility methods in `DatabaseUtil` handle the file copying and connection to the database but do not handle any database operations.
- Consider error handling and resource management when using these methods in a production environment.

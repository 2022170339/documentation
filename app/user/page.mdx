# File Name: `User.java`

## Overview: 
The `User.java` file defines a Java class `User` that represents a user entity. It is annotated with ORMlite annotations to map the class to a database table named "users". The class contains fields for the user's ID, username, password, and a reference to an associated employee. It also includes constructors and getter/setter methods for these fields.

## Usage: 
The `User` class can be used to create and manipulate user objects and store/retrieve them from a database. Below is an example of how to create a `User` object and set its properties in a Java application:

```java
// Create a new User object
User user = new User();

// Set user properties
user.setUsername("john_doe");
user.setPassword("securePassword");

// Assign an employee to the user
Employee employee = new Employee();
user.setEmployee(employee);
```

### Notes
- Ensure that the `Employee` class is available and properly defined to set the `employee` field in the `User` class.
- When using the `User` class with a database, make sure the database table "users" is created with appropriate columns matching the fields in the class.

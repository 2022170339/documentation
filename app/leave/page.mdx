# File Name: `Leave.java`

## Overview: 
The `Leave.java` file is a Java class that represents a leave request in an object-oriented programming model. It defines the structure and behavior of a leave request entity, including attributes like ID, start date, end date, reason, status, and the user associated with the leave request.

## Usage: 
The `Leave` class can be used to create and manage leave requests within an application. Below is an example of how the `Leave` class can be used in a real-world scenario:

```java
// Creating a new leave request
Leave leaveRequest = new Leave();
leaveRequest.setDateStart("2022-10-01");
leaveRequest.setDateEnd("2022-10-05");
leaveRequest.setReason("Vacation");
leaveRequest.setStatus("Pending");

// Associating the leave request with a user
User user = new User();
user.setId(123);
leaveRequest.setUser(user);

// Saving the leave request to the database
LeaveDao leaveDao = new LeaveDao();
leaveDao.create(leaveRequest);
```

### Notes
- The `Leave` class is designed to work with the ORM framework ORMlite, as indicated by the `@DatabaseTable` and `@DatabaseField` annotations.
- Ensure compatibility with the ORMlite version being used in the project.
- Performance considerations may include optimizing database queries related to leave requests.
- Handle edge cases such as invalid dates or null user associations appropriately in the application logic.

# File Name: `OvertimeRepository.java`

## Overview:
The `OvertimeRepository` class is a repository implementation that provides methods to interact with an underlying database using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) concepts. It implements the `IRepository` interface and contains methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on `Overtime` entities.

## Usage:
The `OvertimeRepository` class can be used to interact with the database to perform operations on `Overtime` entities. Here is an example demonstrating how to use the `OvertimeRepository` class:

```java
// Create a connection source
ConnectionSource connectionSource = createConnectionSource();

// Create an instance of OvertimeRepository
OvertimeRepository overtimeRepository = new OvertimeRepository(connectionSource);

// Find Overtime by id
Overtime overtime = overtimeRepository.findById(1);

// Save a new Overtime entity
Overtime newOvertime = new Overtime("John Doe", 10);
overtimeRepository.save(newOvertime);

// Update an existing Overtime entity
overtime.setHoursWorked(12);
overtimeRepository.update(overtime);

// Delete an Overtime entity
overtimeRepository.delete(overtime);

// Find all Overtimes
List<Overtime> allOvertimes = overtimeRepository.findAll();
```

### Notes
- Ensure compatibility with the version of ORMLite library being used.
- Handle exceptions appropriately when interacting with the database.
- Consider performance implications when dealing with a large number of Overtime entities.

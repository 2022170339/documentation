# File Name: `Payroll.java`

## Overview:
The `Payroll.java` file defines a Java class named `Payroll` that represents an entity for storing payroll information. It contains fields for various aspects of payroll such as pay dates, hours worked, different types of pay, deductions, and net pay. This class is annotated with `DatabaseField` annotations from the ORMlite library to define the database table structure.

## Usage:
The `Payroll` class can be used to store and manage payroll information for employees in a company. Below is an example of how to create an instance of the `Payroll` class and set some of the payroll details using Java code:

```java
Payroll payroll = new Payroll();

payroll.setPayBeginDate("2022-01-01");
payroll.setPayEndDate("2022-01-15");
payroll.setTotalHours(80.0);
payroll.setRegularPay(4000.0);
payroll.setOvertimePay(1000.0);
payroll.setSss(200.0);
payroll.setPhilhealth(150.0);
payroll.setTax(500.0);

User user = new User(); // Assuming User class is defined elsewhere
payroll.setUser(user);

// Save the payroll information to the database
// Example: payrollDao.create(payroll);
```

### Notes
- Ensure that the `User` class is properly implemented and associated with the `Payroll` class for the foreign key relationship to work correctly.
- Consider performance implications when dealing with a large number of payroll records, as ORM operations may have overhead.
- Handle edge cases such as invalid payroll data input or database connection failures gracefully in your application.

# File Name: `Authentication.java`

## Overview: 
The `Authentication.java` file contains a Java class named `Authentication` that provides methods for password hashing and authentication using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The `Authentication` class has a static method `hashPassword` to generate a hashed representation of a password and a static method `authenticate` to compare a plain text password with a hashed password string.

## Usage: 
The `Authentication` class can be used in scenarios where secure password storage and authentication are required. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `Authentication` class in a Java application:

```java
package com.example;

import com.mmdc.oop.Utils.Authentication;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String username = "admin";
        String password = "password123";

        // Hash the password
        String hashedPassword = Authentication.hashPassword(password);

        // Simulate authentication process
        boolean isAuthenticated = Authentication.authenticate(username, password, hashedPassword);

        if (isAuthenticated) {
            System.out.println("Authentication successful for user: " + username);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Authentication failed for user: " + username);
        }
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- The `Authentication` class uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for password hashing. Ensure compatibility with other systems that may require a different hashing algorithm.
- Performance considerations: Hashing passwords can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale applications. Consider using salted hashing for additional security.
- Handle edge cases: Properly handle exceptions like `NoSuchAlgorithmException` that may occur during the password hashing process.

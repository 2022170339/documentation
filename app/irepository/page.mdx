# File Name: `IRepository.java`

## Overview: 
The `IRepository.java` file defines an interface `IRepository` that outlines the basic methods for interacting with a generic repository. It includes methods for finding an entity by its ID, retrieving all entities, saving a new entity, updating an existing entity, and deleting an entity.

## Usage: 
The `IRepository` interface can be implemented by classes that need to create repositories for different types of entities. Below is an example of how this interface can be used:

```java
package com.mmdc.oop.Repositories;

import com.mmdc.oop.Interfaces.IRepository;
import java.util.List;

public class EntityRepository implements IRepository<Entity, Long> {

    @Override
    public Entity findById(Long id) {
        // Implementation to find an entity by ID
    }

    @Override
    public List<Entity> findAll() {
        // Implementation to retrieve all entities
    }

    @Override
    public Entity save(Entity entity) {
        // Implementation to save a new entity
    }

    @Override
    public Entity update(Entity entity) {
        // Implementation to update an existing entity
    }

    @Override
    public void delete(Entity entity) {
        // Implementation to delete an entity
    }
}
```

### Notes
- This interface can be extended to create specific repositories for different types of entities.
- It is important to handle exceptions and error cases appropriately in the implementation of these methods.
- Implementations of this interface should ensure proper error handling and data integrity.

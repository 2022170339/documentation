# File Name: `ShowOvertimeRequestsView.java`

## Overview:
The `ShowOvertimeRequestsView.java` file is a Java class that represents a view for displaying overtime requests. It retrieves overtime requests for a specific user, calculates the total hours for each request, and displays the details in a graphical user interface using the Lanterna library.

## Usage:
The `ShowOvertimeRequestsView` class is used to create a window displaying overtime requests for a specific user. It takes the MultiWindowTextGUI instance, the user ID, and a RepositoriesDto object as parameters in the constructor. Here is an example of how to use the `ShowOvertimeRequestsView` class:

```java
// Create an instance of RepositoriesDto
RepositoriesDto repositoriesDto = new RepositoriesDto();

// Create an instance of MultiWindowTextGUI
MultiWindowTextGUI gui = new MultiWindowTextGUI();

// Define the user ID
int userId = 123;

// Create an instance of ShowOvertimeRequestsView
ShowOvertimeRequestsView showOvertimeRequestsView = new ShowOvertimeRequestsView(gui, userId, repositoriesDto);

// Get the window and display it
BasicWindow window = showOvertimeRequestsView.getWindow();
gui.addWindowAndWait(window);
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the Lanterna library is included in the project dependencies to use the graphical user interface components.
- The class filters overtime requests based on the provided user ID and displays the date, total hours, start time, end time, and status of each request.
- The total hours are calculated by parsing the start and end times of each overtime request and calculating the duration between them.
- Exception handling is implemented for parsing time values from strings to LocalTime objects.

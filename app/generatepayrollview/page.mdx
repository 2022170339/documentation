# File Name: `GeneratePayrollView.java`

## Overview:
The `GeneratePayrollView.java` file is a Java class that represents a view for generating payroll for users. It contains methods to display a window with a list of users to select, calculate payroll based on attendance and overtime data, and save the payroll information with deductions and net pay.

## Usage:
The `GeneratePayrollView` class is used to interact with the user interface to generate payroll for selected users. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `GeneratePayrollView` class:

```java
// Create an instance of the GeneratePayrollView with GUI and repositoriesDto
MultiWindowTextGUI gui = new MultiWindowTextGUI();
RepositoriesDto repositoriesDto = new RepositoriesDto();
GeneratePayrollView generatePayrollView = new GeneratePayrollView(gui, repositoriesDto);

// Get the window and display it
BasicWindow window = generatePayrollView.getWindow();
gui.addWindowAndWait(window);
```

### Notes:
- The `GeneratePayrollView` class relies on repositoriesDto to access user, attendance, overtime, and payroll data.
- It calculates total hours worked, regular pay, overtime pay, deductions (SSS, PhilHealth, PAGIBIG, tax), and net pay for each user.
- The class handles error messages for selecting users and date range.

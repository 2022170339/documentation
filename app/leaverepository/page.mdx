# File Name: `LeaveRepository.java`

## Overview: 
The `LeaveRepository` class is a repository implementation that interacts with a database using ORMLite library to perform CRUD operations on `Leave` entities. It provides methods to find a leave by ID, fetch all leaves, save a new leave, update an existing leave, and delete a leave.

## Usage: 
To use the `LeaveRepository` class, you need to provide a `ConnectionSource` object during initialization. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `LeaveRepository` class:

```java
// Creating a ConnectionSource object
ConnectionSource connectionSource = ...; // Initialize your connection source

// Creating a LeaveRepository instance
LeaveRepository leaveRepository = new LeaveRepository(connectionSource);

// Finding a leave by ID
Leave leave = leaveRepository.findById(1);

// Fetching all leaves
List<Leave> allLeaves = leaveRepository.findAll();

// Saving a new leave
Leave newLeave = new Leave(); // Initialize your leave object
Leave savedLeave = leaveRepository.save(newLeave);

// Updating an existing leave
Leave existingLeave = ...; // Fetch an existing leave object
existingLeave.setSomeProperty("New Value");
Leave updatedLeave = leaveRepository.update(existingLeave);

// Deleting a leave
Leave leaveToDelete = ...; // Fetch a leave object to delete
leaveRepository.delete(leaveToDelete);
```

### Notes
- Ensure compatibility with the ORMLite library version being used.
- Consider performance implications when dealing with large datasets.
- Handle exceptions and edge cases appropriately to maintain data integrity.

# File Name: `UserRole.java`

## Overview:
The `UserRole.java` file defines a Java class `UserRole` that represents the association between a `User` and a `Role`. It uses the ORMLite library annotations to map the class to a database table named "user_roles". The class contains fields for the user's ID, the associated `User` object, and the associated `Role` object. Additionally, it provides constructors and getter/setter methods to manipulate these fields.

## Usage:
The `UserRole` class can be used to establish the relationship between a `User` and a `Role` in a database. Here is an example of how you can create an instance of `UserRole` and set the user and role:

```java
// Create a User and Role instance
User user = new User("John");
Role role = new Role("Admin");

// Create a UserRole instance linking the User and Role
UserRole userRole = new UserRole(user, role);

// Get the User and Role from the UserRole instance
User retrievedUser = userRole.getUser();
Role retrievedRole = userRole.getRole();
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `User` and `Role` classes are properly defined and mapped with ORMLite to prevent any mapping errors.
- Performance considerations may arise when dealing with a large number of `UserRoles`. Consider optimizing queries or indexing based on your specific use case.
- Handle edge cases such as null values for `User` or `Role` objects to prevent NullPointerExceptions during operations.

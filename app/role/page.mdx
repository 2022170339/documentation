# File Name: `Role.java`

## Overview:
The `Role.java` file defines a Java class named `Role` that represents a role entity in an object-oriented programming system. This class is annotated with ORMlite annotations for database mapping, specifying the table name as "roles" and defining fields for the role ID and role name.

## Usage:
The `Role` class can be used to model roles in a system and interact with a corresponding database table. Below is an example demonstrating how to create an instance of the `Role` class and utilize its methods:

```java
import com.mmdc.oop.Models.Role;

// Create a new role instance
Role role = new Role();

// Set the role name
role.setRoleName("Admin");

// Get the role ID and role name
int roleId = role.getId();
String roleName = role.getRoleName();

System.out.println("Role ID: " + roleId);
System.out.println("Role Name: " + roleName);
```

### Notes
- This class is designed to work with ORMlite library for object-relational mapping.
- Ensure proper database configuration and connection for the class to interact with a database.
- Handle null values appropriately when setting the role name to avoid exceptions.

# File Name: `EmployeeRepository.java`

## Overview:
The `EmployeeRepository.java` file contains the implementation of a repository class for handling CRUD operations related to the `Employee` entity. It utilizes the ORMLite library to interact with the database and provides methods for finding, saving, updating, and deleting Employee objects.

## Usage:
The `EmployeeRepository` class can be used in a Java application to interact with an underlying database table storing Employee records. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the methods of this class:

```java
// Creating a new EmployeeRepository instance
ConnectionSource connectionSource = ...; // Initialize your connection source
EmployeeRepository employeeRepo = new EmployeeRepository(connectionSource);

// Finding an Employee by ID
Employee foundEmployee = employeeRepo.findById(1);

// Saving a new Employee
Employee newEmployee = new Employee("John Doe", "john@example.com");
Employee savedEmployee = employeeRepo.save(newEmployee);

// Updating an existing Employee
savedEmployee.setEmail("john.doe@example.com");
Employee updatedEmployee = employeeRepo.update(savedEmployee);

// Deleting an Employee
employeeRepo.delete(savedEmployee);

// Finding all Employees
List<Employee> allEmployees = employeeRepo.findAll();
```

### Notes
- This class is compatible with the ORMLite library for ORM operations.
- Ensure proper exception handling for database connectivity and query operations.
- Performance can be optimized by using batch operations for multiple inserts or updates.
- Handle edge cases such as null inputs or database connection failures appropriately.

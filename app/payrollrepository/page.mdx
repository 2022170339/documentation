# File Name: `PayrollRepository.java`

## Overview:
The `PayrollRepository` Java class is responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations on `Payroll` entities. It implements the `IRepository` interface with methods to find by ID, find all, save, update, and delete payroll records.

## Usage:
The `PayrollRepository` class can be used to manage payroll data persistence in a Java application. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the class in a real-world scenario:

### Example:
```java
// Create a connection source
ConnectionSource connectionSource = createConnectionSource();

// Instantiate the PayrollRepository
PayrollRepository payrollRepository = new PayrollRepository(connectionSource);

// Save a new Payroll entity
Payroll newPayroll = new Payroll("John Doe", 1000.00); // Assuming Payroll constructor takes name and amount
payrollRepository.save(newPayroll);

// Find a Payroll by ID
Payroll foundPayroll = payrollRepository.findById(1);

// Update an existing Payroll entity
foundPayroll.setAmount(1200.00);
payrollRepository.update(foundPayroll);

// Delete a Payroll entity
payrollRepository.delete(foundPayroll);

// Get all Payroll records
List<Payroll> allPayrolls = payrollRepository.findAll();
```

### Notes:
- This class relies on the ORMLite library for database operations.
- Ensure proper exception handling for `SQLException` in real-world usage.
- Consider performance implications when dealing with a large number of Payroll records.

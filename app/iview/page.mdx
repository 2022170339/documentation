# File Name: `IView.java`
## Overview: 
The `IView` interface defines a method `getWindow()` that returns a `BasicWindow` object. This interface is intended to be implemented by classes that represent a view in a user interface system.

## Usage: 
The `IView` interface can be implemented by classes to create various types of views in a user interface application. Below is an example of how `IView` can be used:

```java
package com.mmdc.oop.Views;

import com.googlecode.lanterna.gui2.BasicWindow;
import com.mmdc.oop.Interfaces.IView;

public class MainView implements IView {

  private BasicWindow window;

  public MainView() {
    window = new BasicWindow("Main Window");
    // Additional view initialization logic
  }

  @Override
  public BasicWindow getWindow() {
    return window;
  }
}
```

### Notes
- This interface is compatible with classes that use `BasicWindow` from the Lanterna library.
- When implementing this interface, consider performance implications of the methods in the implementing class, especially if they involve heavy computations.
- Handle any edge cases related to creating and managing windows in the implementing classes to ensure smooth user interface interactions.

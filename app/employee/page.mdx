# File Name: `Employee.java`

## Overview:
The `Employee.java` file defines a Java class representing an employee in a system. It contains various fields to store employee information such as name, contact details, employment details, and emergency contact information. The class utilizes the ORM mapping annotations from the `ormlite` library to map Java objects to database tables.

## Usage:
The `Employee` class can be used to create and manage employee data within an application. Below is a basic example of how to create an instance of the `Employee` class and set some attributes:

```java
import com.mmdc.oop.Models.Employee;

// Create a new Employee instance
Employee employee = new Employee();

// Set employee details
employee.setFirstName("John");
employee.setLastName("Doe");
employee.setDateOfBirth("1990-05-15");
employee.setEmail("john.doe@example.com");
employee.setDepartment("IT");
employee.setEmployeeType("Full Time");
employee.setSalary(50000.0);
employee.setShiftStartTime("08:00");
employee.setShiftEndTime("17:00");

// Get employee details
System.out.println("Employee Name: " + employee.getFirstName() + " " + employee.getLastName());
System.out.println("Employee Email: " + employee.getEmail());
System.out.println("Employee Department: " + employee.getDepartment());
System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + employee.getSalary());
```

### Notes:
- Ensure compatibility with the `ormlite` library version being used.
- Consider performance implications when working with a large number of `Employee` objects.
- Handle edge cases such as null values for optional fields appropriately in your application logic.

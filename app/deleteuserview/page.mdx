# File Name: `DeleteUserView.java`

## Overview:
The `DeleteUserView.java` file is a Java class that represents a view for deleting a user in an application. It utilizes the Lanterna library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and labels. The view prompts the user to confirm the deletion of a user and handles the deletion process by interacting with user and employee repositories.

## Usage:
The `DeleteUserView` class can be used in an application to present a confirmation dialog for deleting a user. Below is an example of how to use this class to create the delete user view:

```java
// Create repositoriesDto object with necessary repositories
RepositoriesDto repositoriesDto = new RepositoriesDto(userRepository, employeeRepository, userRoleRepository);

// Create MultiWindowTextGUI object
MultiWindowTextGUI gui = new MultiWindowTextGUI(screen);

// Instantiate DeleteUserView passing gui, user id, and repositoriesDto
DeleteUserView deleteUserView = new DeleteUserView(gui, userId, repositoriesDto);

// Get the window from DeleteUserView
BasicWindow deleteUserWindow = deleteUserView.getWindow();

// Add the window to the GUI and display it
gui.addWindow(deleteUserWindow);
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `RepositoriesDto` object passed to the `DeleteUserView` constructor contains the required repositories.
- The view assumes the existence of user, employee, and user role repositories for handling the delete operation.
- Handle edge cases such as user not found and appropriate success or error messages.
- The class follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern by separating the view logic from the data and business logic.

# File Name: `EditUserView.java`
## Overview: 
The `EditUserView` class is a Java file that implements the `IView` interface. It represents a view for editing user information in a GUI application. The class contains GUI components for editing user details such as login information, employee information, user role selection, work days selection, and shift hours configuration.

## Usage: 
The `EditUserView` class is used to display a window for editing user details, including login information, employee information, user roles, workdays, and shift hours. It allows users to update user information and save the changes.

```java
// Example of creating an EditUserView instance and displaying the window
MultiWindowTextGUI gui = new MultiWindowTextGUI();
RepositoriesDto repositoriesDto = new RepositoriesDto(/* pass repositories */);
EditUserView editUserView = new EditUserView(gui, userId, repositoriesDto);
gui.addWindowAndWait(editUserView.getWindow());
```

### Notes:
- The class uses the Lanterna library for creating GUI components.
- Ensure all required fields are filled before updating the user information.
- Validate input data such as salary, hourly rate, and shift times to ensure they are in the correct format.
- Handle edge cases such as password confirmation and user role selection.
- The class follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for separating concerns.

The `EditUserView` class provides a user-friendly interface for updating user information efficiently in a GUI application.

# File Name: `UserRepository.java`

## Overview: 
The `UserRepository.java` file is a class that implements the `IRepository` interface for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to the `User` model. It utilizes ORMLite, a lightweight Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, to interact with the database. The class provides methods to find a user by ID, retrieve all users, save a new user, update an existing user, and delete a user from the database.

## Usage: 
The `UserRepository` class can be used to interact with a database to perform operations on user entities. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `UserRepository` class:

```java
// Create a connection source
ConnectionSource connectionSource = new JdbcConnectionSource(databaseUrl, username, password);

// Instantiate the UserRepository
UserRepository userRepository = new UserRepository(connectionSource);

// Find a user by ID
User user = userRepository.findById(1);

// Retrieve all users
List<User> allUsers = userRepository.findAll();

// Create a new user
User newUser = new User("John", "Doe");
userRepository.save(newUser);

// Update an existing user
user.setLastName("Smith");
userRepository.update(user);

// Delete a user
userRepository.delete(user);

// Close the connection after use
connectionSource.close();
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `User` model class is properly defined and compatible with ORMLite annotations for correct database mapping.
- Performance considerations may include optimizing database queries and transactions for efficiency.
- Handle exceptions appropriately to manage errors during database operations.

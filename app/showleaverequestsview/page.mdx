# File Name: `ShowLeaveRequestsView.java`

## Overview:
The `ShowLeaveRequestsView` class is a Java class that implements the `IView` interface. It is responsible for displaying leave requests for a specific user in a window using the Lanterna library. The view consists of a list of leave requests with details such as type, start date, end date, and status.

## Usage:
The `ShowLeaveRequestsView` class can be used to create a window that displays leave requests for a specific user. Below is an example of how to use the `ShowLeaveRequestsView` class:

```java
// Create a MultiWindowTextGUI instance
MultiWindowTextGUI gui = new MultiWindowTextGUI();

// Create a RepositoriesDto instance
RepositoriesDto repositoriesDto = new RepositoriesDto(); // assuming repositories are initialized

// Specify the user ID for which leave requests should be displayed
int userId = 123;

// Create an instance of ShowLeaveRequestsView
ShowLeaveRequestsView showLeaveRequestsView = new ShowLeaveRequestsView(gui, userId, repositoriesDto);

// Get the BasicWindow from the ShowLeaveRequestsView instance
BasicWindow window = showLeaveRequestsView.getWindow();

// Add the window to the GUI
gui.addWindowAndWait(window);
```

### Notes:
- The `ShowLeaveRequestsView` class relies on the Lanterna library for GUI components.
- Ensure that the `RepositoriesDto` object passed to the constructor contains initialized repositories.
- The leave requests are filtered based on the provided `userId`.
- The window includes details such as the type of leave, start date, end date, and status for each leave request.
- The window includes a "Close" button that allows the user to close the window.
